0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

Background Context: The AirBnB clone project aims to create a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform. In this initial step, we’ll build a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This is a crucial foundation for subsequent tasks, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

Here are the key tasks we will tackle:

    BaseModel Class:
        We’ll create a parent class called BaseModel responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing instances.
        The flow will involve converting instances to dictionaries, then to JSON strings, and finally saving them to files.

    AirBnB Classes:
        We’ll define classes (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel.
        These classes will represent different objects within the AirBnB system.

    Storage Engine:
        Our first storage engine will be a simple file-based system.
        We’ll abstract away the details of saving and retrieving objects from files.

    Unit Testing:
        We’ll create comprehensive unit tests to validate our classes and storage engine.

What’s a Command Interpreter? Think of it as a specialized version of the Shell. While the Shell is a general-purpose command-line interface, our command interpreter will focus solely on managing AirBnB objects. Here’s what it allows us to do:

    Create: We can create new objects (e.g., users, places) within our system.
    Retrieve: We can fetch objects from files or databases.
    Operate: We can perform operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing statistics).
    Update: We can modify attributes of existing objects.
    Destroy: We can delete objects when needed.
