AirBnB_clone
Project Description:

The AirBnB_clone project is a command-line interface (CLI) application that replicates the basic functionality of the Airbnb website. It allows users to manage and interact with data related to properties, users, bookings, and more.
Command Interpreter Overview:

The command interpreter provides a CLI interface for interacting with the AirBnB_clone project. Here's a brief overview:

Here are the key tasks we’ll tackle:

    BaseModel Class:
        We’ll create a parent class called BaseModel responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing instances.
        The flow will involve converting instances to dictionaries, then to JSON strings, and finally saving them to files.

    AirBnB Classes:
        We’ll define classes (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel.
        These classes will represent different objects within the AirBnB system.

    Storage Engine:
        Our first storage engine will be a simple file-based system.
        We’ll abstract away the details of saving and retrieving objects from files.

    Unit Testing:
        We’ll create comprehensive unit tests to validate our classes and storage engine.

What’s a Command Interpreter? Think of it as a specialized version of the Shell. While the Shell is a general-purpose command-line interface, our command interpreter will focus solely on managing AirBnB objects. Here’s what it allows us to do:

    Create: We can create new objects (e.g., users, places) within our system.
    Retrieve: We can fetch objects from files or databases.
    Operate: We can perform operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing statistics).
    Update: We can modify attributes of existing objects.
    Destroy: We can delete objects when needed.

Resources to Explore:

    cmd module: Provides tools for building command interpreters.
    uuid module: Useful for generating unique identifiers.
    datetime: Helps with handling date and time.
    unittest module: Essential for writing unit tests.
    Understanding packages and Python package creation.
    Familiarize yourself with command-line interfaces and their usage.

How to Start:

To start the command interpreter, run the console.py file in your terminal.

How to Use:

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to perform various actions, such as creating, showing, updating, or deleting instances of classes like User, Property, Review, and more.
